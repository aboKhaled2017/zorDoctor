            Nature of the Content Appearing on our Services
            Overview
            Our Services may include text, data, graphics, images, or other content (collectively, “Content”) created by us or third parties, including health care providers and partners as physicians, hospitals, polyclinics, laboratories, scan centers and pharmacies.

            1. Our Services
            1.1 Public Services
            We make some Services available without registering or obtaining a password. We call these “Public Services.” You may make personal, non-commercial use of the Public Services so long as you comply with these Terms.
            These services include: Directories for: Physicians, medical consultants, lab branches and scan centers’ branches.
            Our Services include listings and directories (“Directories”) to help you find physicians, healthcare providers, lab branches and scan centers’ branches (collectively, “Providers”). The Directories are provided for your convenience. The Directories are not comprehensive, but rather generally represent Providers who use our Services and who have chosen to participate in the Directories. Further, Vezeeta does not interfere in evaluating any Provider, only patients and consumers who have log in rights do the evaluation based on their opinion and the listing of a Provider does not in any way constitute a recommendation of such Provider. Before obtaining services or treatment from any Provider listed in a Directory, you should take the same care you would under any other circumstance, including by confirming licensure and specialty certifications. The Providers are solely responsible for the appropriateness and quality of the services they provide. Additionally, the Directories rely on information submitted by Providers themselves. Unless Providers provide us with current information, the Directory information may not be timely or accurate. You should confirm such information before obtaining services or treatment from a Provider. As a convenience, the Services may permit you to request an appointment with a Provider. However, Providers are responsible for maintaining their own schedules, and we cannot ensure that any given Provider will be available, or that such Provider will not cancel his or her appointment.

            1.2 Protected Services
            Some of our Services are protected by technical measures intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our users store and share using our Services. We call these “Protected Services.” One such safeguard is requiring each user to be properly authenticated by means of authorization (which we call, “Credentials”), such as unique identifiers, usernames, passwords, and the like. In order to obtain Credentials, you must provide certain information about yourself. If you are registering for a Protected Service, or accessing or using, or attempting to access or use, a Protected Service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, someone other than yourself – such as any of your family members (each, a “Principal”) – you must also identify and provide information about each Principal. If you sign up for our Protected Services you will be asked to agree to a user agreement (your “User Agreement”). In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to your User Agreement, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button with terms such as “I agree” or the like. In the event of a conflict between the terms of your User Agreement and of these Terms, the terms of your User Agreement shall control.
            These protected services are all services that build you a personal medical record, like receiving your medical information and results from service providers like laboratories, scan centers and physicians’ accounts
            These data are completely private and secured and we hereby guarantee so. You are the owner of the data and by clicking “I agree” or like you give the providers the right to send you your information provided by them through your private account on the website, in order to help you build your own electronic medical record. Also, you may agree to send a copy of these data to the supplier doctor through our service. That is also a protected and private he cannot share furthermore, he keeps it under your name on his account for building your record at the clinic. In case you do not agree that the physician keeps a record of your data, you can send Vezeeta your request, and Vezeeta shall comply with this request

            1.3 Blog Posts; Ratings; Surveys; Comments; User-Submitted Content
            Our Services allow you to access blogs, message boards, surveys and other forums where various users can share information, opinions, ratings and other Content. We generally do not pre-screen or monitor user-submitted Content, and such Content may simply represent a user’s opinion or Content a user finds interesting. Our Services may also include survey results, ratings or testimonials (“Evaluations”) from patients, clients or other customers (“Doctors”) or other healthcare providers (“Providers”) that may endorse, recommend, critique, analyze, evaluate or otherwise describe the Providers and the nature or quality of the services received by such patient, client or customer. Such Evaluations are anecdotal first-hand accounts of individual Patients, and are neither provider judgments nor the product of medical science. Such Evaluations do not in any way constitute or imply our endorsement or recommendation of any Provider. Further, Evaluations are subject to errors and biases that are common in anecdotal first- hand accounts, and should not to be presumed to be reliable or error-free.
